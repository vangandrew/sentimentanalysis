# sentimentanalysis

This is a sentiment analysis project on made up Hospital Reviews. 
I use VADER and Roberta Machine Learning Models to predict whether that review was a negative or positive review based on a scale of -1 to 1.
Also used matplotlib and seaborn to do basic EDA and basic plotting to show the trends between a positive and negative review.
